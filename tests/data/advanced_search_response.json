He also talked with secondary school students and teachers, and made a visit to a conference on remote sensing funded jointly by the U.S.-Egypt Science and Technology Fund. His visit to Egypt comes shortly after the first anniversary of President Barack Obama's historic visit to Cairo in which he launched his New Beginning Initiative to enhance cooperation and understanding between the U.S. and the Muslim world, especially in the fields of science and technology. This visit also follows visits by other senior American figures in the fields of science and technology, including the Presidential Science and Technology Envoy Dr. Ahmed Zewail, to explore means for future cooperation between the U.S. and Muslim majority countries.
